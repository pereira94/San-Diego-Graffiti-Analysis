# The San Diego Graffiti Problem

**The Data**

San Diego county has a program called 'Get it done San Diego' through which residents can report issues for the county to 
correct, such as 72-hour violations, illegal dumping, and graffiti. The county then fixes the issue, or forwards the issue 
to the appropriate organization. I pulled public data from the county website on the request for graffiti removal dating back to 2016. The data set contains information on when the request was submitted, its current status, when it was completed, coordinates of where the graffiti was sighted, source of the request, among other categories. 

**Source**

Data was obtained as a csv file from the county website. The original file can be downloaded from [here](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/gid-graffiti-removal/)

**Things to consider about the data**

The data only goes back to May 2016. The most recent data collected is up to March 2020. Additionally, there is a significant amount of data missing, specifically for the Chula Vista and National City communities. These communities make up a significant portion of the San Diego population. However, there is no report of graffiti from these communities. This analysis should be explored while keeping this in mind. 

**Questions to be answered**

I mainly wanted to explore the overall trend of the graffiti situation in San Diego. I also wanted to identify which communities had the most graffiti complaints. I rellied heavily on visualizations to show geographical data. I was also interested in the source of the reports, as well as how long it took for a request to get processed.
